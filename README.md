# Text-Captcha
## Executive Summary
---
This text stream is aiming to develop a fully functional program for breaking text CAPTCHAs. The program is based on Artificial Intelligence technologies to automatically extract the text from the captcha image with high noise level and complicated background.   
Our current CRNN approach is evaluated by a grayscale CAPTCHA dataset, which provides promising result with high accuracy rate. Future development will focus on expanding training dataset for current model and developing a program to breaking input CAPTCHA from users.

## Project Progress
---
This project is still under early R&D phases. Currently, we have created a simple image-processing module for raw data and a CRNN model to extract the captchas into text format. The whole program could be accessed from [Text_captcha.ipynb](https://github.com/nbonair/Text-Captcha/blob/main/Text_captcha_CNN.ipynb)
